Assignment 2
Student: James Brooks

Compiling
-----------

Should compile without modification.
May require retargeting solution and changing compile mode to x86.
Sometimes when opening the solution for the first time it auto
changes to x64 (which, of course, does not work with our libraries).



Everything is implemented from assignment page.

Bonuses:
Depth Effect: Depth test allows objects to render in order of depth.
Direction lighting: A light (The star in the middle) shines a yellow
    light in a single direction at the monster.



CONTROLS
--------------
W - move forward
S - move backward
A - move left
D - move right
Q - rotate left
E - rotate right
R - ascend up
F - descend down

You can move and rotate freely and properly.
Rotation appropriately effects movement direction.
