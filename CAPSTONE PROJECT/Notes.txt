---------------------------

attacks are scrips with an attack function, range check function, and a total damage output function
	Attack scripts will hold the logic for what happens during an attack.
	Attacks will have a list of properties (attributes) such as grapple, slow, etc
	These properties will have a rock paper scissors hierarchy to see what works with what
	for proper capatalization by the enemies

have a CA event style structure for enemy behaviours, add the bahaviour tree seperatly as a parameter
	Instead of always checking decisions, behaviours are determined by the tree

Have a heauristic that checks if the attack can hit the player and the damage itll do,
	the heuristic will also check if other allies engageing the player on the blackboard
	have posted that their attacks have connected for possible foll.owups.
	EG if a grapple has been landed, it adds to the heauristic of an attack that follows
	up on grapples.

Have a singleton blackboard that keeps track of enemeies engaged with the player, thus not having to
	check all enemies to see what theyre doing all the time. Enemy script will add itseslf when
	in LOS and remove when out of LOS for a set time.
