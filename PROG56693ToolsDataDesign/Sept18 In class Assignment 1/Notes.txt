Splines
good for smooth curves and shapes

Parametric equation what is it?
Basically your curves thats what we use to make the smooth line from point a to b
Vector3.lurb is our linear interpolation gives us a point on that curve between a and b
Manual (b-a)t ?

3 types of motion equations in our toolbox
parametric
historeses well deal with later
spline - just like parametric byt creates a smooth curve between multiple points

spline types
- besacre
- permiate
- b spline
- beta spline
- catwell ronspliler? - doesnt neccessarily give good curve cause it has a momentum so it needs to make turns like a car. Good for camera paths. uses a matrix to make path between for points 

IN CLASSS ASSIGNMENT create catwell ron
- 
4 game objects. Head a game obj where we are on curve, script component called spline which has public float t that we can adjust in inspector to slide it, public list game objects called like control points to drag our 4 objs in, public game obj for head. When we hit t from 0-1 it should move between 4 points


CONVEX HUL:L prpoerty
The bounding box of those 4 points where the movement of object t must stay within those bounds. For catmull rom it doe ntot full obey those properties.
