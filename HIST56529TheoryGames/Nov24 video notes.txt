Narratology and ludology combined the small bits of game study spread across things like economics, philosiphy, film stufy etc.

ludology (mehcnaics_ and narrative (story) are often ocnflicting with each other and people say that games cant be judged by both together. (Think biuoshock narrative about selfish interest society falls apart yet your mechanics you gain power for self interest). Yet both side make up the whole of a game.

Guy talks about how to bring narative to games and make it a unique art. Says we can express verbs using art and movies are above the head verbs like negotiation talking visuals etc game aer more below the head like jumping shooting etc.
In order to bring above the head hesays we need characters, Especially those that remember of us that we can take along with us, Our charcters we play are like avatars tha tare our buddies and do stuff on their own but let us  take control too. So these characters becomeing more like virtual companions or buddies that do stuff with us and can talk with us about what happens and become a friend.
