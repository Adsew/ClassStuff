Zork and space invaders

Hey everyone! 

I've added a Play! Critical Assignment sample to SLATE under
CONTENT > ASSIGNMENT SHEETS 

You can use the same format as this student: a small personal response for each game followed by responses to the 3 questions:

1) What kind of gameplay experiences do so-called classic games (early popular digital games) provide for a modern player?

2) Is an old digital game worthy of attention only for historical reasons, or does it still fascinate and have staying power?

3)  How can we account for the possible nostalgia and the effect of one’s personal memories?

In some cases, you won't have any real nostalgia for a game (and that's ok!) but you might still be aware of a game even if you've never played it.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

- Jen
