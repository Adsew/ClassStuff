Increase score on target

NEVCER DO THIS: GameObject.find("a game object"), getComp, then use. Poor practice. Obj name could change etc.

NEVER DO THIS: Drag the script to the references list in unity at design time. Doesnt let you do stuff in code as well at runtime. References dont hold from prefabs. So a pattern to a game obj in the game references will be null but if you copied exisintg ones in the game scene they will still be there

DO make a static item in a class to make itaccessable everywehre

Cabvas items are in their own heirarchy. UI objs have to be a child of the canvas. Dont use GUItext and whatever else now theyre outdated.

Adding sound using clips. BVest way to have a central location with global for all clip references. Playing on button push
