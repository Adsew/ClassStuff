Things we did

Changing coord of instantiating an object

Add component to spawner and get that sub object from script

Using tags to make sets or find components in scripts

rotation of spawn obj


FOR MIDTERM this is the component script not the object it is attached to. this.gameObject is the object it is attached to

a transform has position scale and rotation

quadrian? quaternion (quad) is a 4 vector with x,y,z,roation (around it)
it is used to fix gimblelock where 2 axis collapse on each other. If you rotate 2 axis the machine will stop rotating.

Ways to get child object references
-> transform.getchild
-> create new script object in unity on the script component and use that in the code
->GameObject.Find finds it by name but if something changes you have to change the name everywhere
-> Add meta data to locate it. Like using tags
	FindObjWithTag. Problems oculd be it doesnt know which obj to use if multiple use same tag.Another problem is you can only have 1 tag per game object.
-> Way we will use is make a new component and search using getcomponentinchildren<component to search>
