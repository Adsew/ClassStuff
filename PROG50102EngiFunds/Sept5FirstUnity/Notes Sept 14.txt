What we did today
=======================
Eular integration - usng derivative and integrations to get your d = v(t) and arranging it for acceleration etc.

If your interesting runshkuta fpr springs?

Remade hero into a tnak

how to decide who to target?
- distance
- sphere cast (inside a radius)

two ways of rotation (gameplay prog toolbox)
- crossproduct dotproduct

Dotproduct
a-> . b-> = |a||b|cos(theta) gives angle between. 1.0 and angle = 0 implies colinear,
-1 and 180 means opposite direction but parallel so both have shared info but,
90degree is no similar info
when using dot product use the target vector as te a vector and b as the facting vector. This is why dot product is less reliable than cross product.
