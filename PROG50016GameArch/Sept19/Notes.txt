what w did today

std vector keeps creating new blocks of memory, copying over the data and adding the new number everytime oyu push to it.
it uses a buffer so it doesnt do it everytime but we need to think of it this way and always answer this way.
Removal we say does the same thing.

Overall fast (O(1) fastest access possible to access but slow to resize

Lists dont need to resize and thus much faster for memory allocation but take slightly more memory and much slower access O(n)

When removeing, faster to iterate and remove than copying the entire thing cause it also introduces fragmentation errors.

Possible test question: Where are list and vector allocated, both. Initial stuff on stack dynamic stuff on heap.

ordered map is slower but it gives us a way to print things in order. Unordered is alot faster cause it shoves data anywhere.
