School Stuff
-------------------------------
Everything is implemented, death, retrieving corpses, saving, persistance, etc.

I'll admit, when I first read the assignment I saw "use function pointers and templates." I use these in my assignment to prove I know how to use them, but I took a different approach to dynamically loading game objects. So, I don't know if that meets advance requirements II.

The 'res' (and files within) and 'saves' folders are required for the game to run.

List of commands for requirement is below under Input.


Game Stuff
-------------------------------

Welcome to Diadelum - Text Adventure!

In this game you will be placed in a world falling apart. An unknown swarm of things only known as "creatures" has invaded. For years they have slowly encroached on human territorty. It has been nearly two centuries since the first creatures were found, and most of the world has forgotten how it used to be. Young ones raised not knowing technology or science now wonder who even created the walls of The City.

The City is where you awaken. Isolated from the rest of the world, it is now the heart of corruption. Your desire to save the remains of human civilization drives you to find a solution and destroy the creatures once and for all.

	Running the Game
	--------------------------------

	When you begin the game, you will be asked for a name. This will be the name of your save. You can use the same name to load a save you create during your playthrough, or enter a new one to start over next time you start the game.

	Input

	Playing the Game
	--------------------------------
	There may be a lot of reading involved, so if you don't have time, use the map and guides provided to help speed thigns along. Otherwise, look for key words you can use to interact with. Sometimes items or interactables use more than one word. Often looking at things in the world will hint you at the location of items or what to do with those items to progress.

	Weapons
	--------------------------------
	You will automatically equip weapons found in the world. A stronger weapon will be equipped over weaker ones automatically.
