Big test problem why calling derived class function calls base class function why?
Can cause problems when deirived calass is supposed to manage some extra memory or something. Especially when calling delete on something like Object thing = new Component() deleting it only calls object's destructor not ocmponents.
This is becauce c uses static binding, we have to distinctly say overridden using virtual function.

ON TEST virtual on a destructor. Check which is being used always because destructor is not calling through the hierarchy like constructor is.

virtual void functionName() override final

final allows you to stop people from overriding any further. Override just tells you right away if you can override somehting
